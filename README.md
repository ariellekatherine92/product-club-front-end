# Sea Levels and Real Estate

The problem we chose to solve as a group is how raising sea levels contribute to real estate values and safety for those living there. As climate change continues to rampage through our lives causing condo collapses, rare weather in certain areas of the USA, along with mass floods and wild fires, we as humans can utilize maps and technology to stay abreast of what could happen within a certain timeframe and build/innovate accordingly. This application will allow real estate developers as well as the general population to make informed decisions on where to live and develop land. 

# Initial WireFrames

For our initial wireframe/planning stage of this project we wanted it to be as user-friendly/concise as possible. We really wanted the design/UX to be clean and well organized. We wanted to ensure there was a login/signup option so people could save searches, and have their own profile. We want the home page to be clean and simple to get the point across directly to the consumer.
